Instructions:
Every time you change the input value, the factorial is calculated
factorialOf(n) and 'factorialOf(n) called!' is logged to console.
On the other side, each time you click Re-render button, inc state value
is updated.
Updating inc state value triggers <CalculateFactorial /> re-rendering.
But, as a secondary effect, during re-rendering the factorial is
recalculated again â€” 'factorialOf(n) called!' is logged to console
See if there is any optimized way to fix it.

*/

/* The issue we have is that when we click button the factorial function is
called again. (check the console)
The inc state is just a counter that doesnt have any functionality excpet
to re-render the code each time it's changed.
So either we can remove the inc state thus preventing re-rendering or
make it so that each time button is clicked, the code will re-render only
if the value of number has changed
This can be done simply by using a useEffect(AltSol.js) or useMemo hook

memoizing expensive calculations. It will recompute the memoized value
 only when one of the dependencies has changed.*/
